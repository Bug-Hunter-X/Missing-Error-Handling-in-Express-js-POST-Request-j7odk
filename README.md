# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for invalid user input.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks validation and error handling for the `POST /users` request. If the request body is malformed or missing required fields, the server might crash or return unexpected responses.

## Solution

The solution involves validating the request body and implementing appropriate error handling.  This includes checking for required fields and data types and returning meaningful error messages to the client.
